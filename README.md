# FizzBuzz Challenge 

Web development application project that uses Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JS that access provided USF API, sends and recieve data that will then simmulate a FizzBuzz game
<br>

FizzBuzz is a game that player(s) takes turn counting upwards, saying Fizz if divisible by 3, Buzz if divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz if divisible by both.

Used as a technical assestment for USF AVC, API calls will not work unless replaced by a backend like firebase or a basic Node backend.
